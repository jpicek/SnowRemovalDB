To Do
**********

- To make this fully usable for a real business, more aggregate functions would be helpful,
	some examples of that are:
	* Searching Removals by Name should SUM each separate Customer, ie:
		Search "MARIO" should provide SUM of Mario Mario,
		and SUM of Luigi Mario, for like a "Total Owed"
	* A Paid/Unpaid query using similar logic to the SUM(IF() for wasSnowRemoved
		and wasWalkwaySalted in the RemovalsPrices VIEW to generate a
		report on which customers have remaining balances
	* I have not implemented these, my VIEWs and front-end seem to be
		too complicated already
